# library-management-system

A simple, modular Python program to manage a library's book inventory.

## Overview
This program offers a simple menu to manage a library. Users can add new books, view the library catalog, or search for books by title or author.<br>

This project is composed of two Python modules:
- `book.py` - Defines the `Book` class, representing books as objects with attributes `title`, `author`, and `isbn`.
- `library_manager.py` - Provides functionality to add, list, and search books through a command-line menu.

Users can interact with a pre-defined sample library to test and explore the program.
